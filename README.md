# Different-algorithms
Just small exercises

My realizations of different sort algorithms:

myxrange.cpp - container as light implementation of pythons' xrange generator. </br>
myDiff.cpp  -  light implementation of command diff func. It takes 2 arguments - names of files and return diffence of two files sentence by sentence. </br>
NN_vs_Lin_est.ipynb  - notebook with exercise with comparison of neural network (NN) estimation for signal vs. linear model estimation calculated by analytical formulas.</br>
Qsort_vs_InsertSort_vs_BubbleSort.ipynb - exercise with comparison of 3 sort algorithms by number of comparisons and number of swaps in arrays. </br>
